.class
Implementation of the Modern Robotics Range Sensor,
a combination of an ultrasonic sensor and an optical (EOPD) range sensor.
The ultrasonic sensor is intended for longer distances and
the EOPD is intended for very short distances (at most a few inches).
Note that which sensor gives better values depends also on the
shape and material of the surface.
The two sensors can be read individually, or you can use {@link #getDistance},
which will automatically select between the two sensors' values.

.method double cmUltrasonic()
Gets the distance as reported by the ultrasonic sensor, in centimeters
@return The approximate distance to the nearest centimeter (0 - 255cm)

.method double cmOptical()
Gets the distance as reported by the EOPD sensor, in centimeters.
Note that this value depends on how reflective the surface is.
@return The approximate distance to the target, if it is quite close
