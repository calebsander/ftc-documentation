.class
Represents a device with several I2C ports.
On the Legacy Module, each port is separate,
but on the Device Interface Module all the ports are
physically on the same bus, so be sure not to have
conflicting I2C addresses on the DIM.
All I2C interactions are asynchronous (meaning the user
must request one to be performed and then handle
the result at some other time).
It is possible to read or write up to 26 contiguous
registers at the same time.
The read buffer contains what the controller most
recently indicated its copy of the write buffer was.

.field I2C_BUFFER_START_ADDRESS
The index in the read and write buffers where the data begins.
Metadata is located before this index in the buffers.

.method SerialNumber getSerialNumber()
Gets the FTDI serial number of the module.
@return the serial number (text version will look like "AL00VDDK")

.method void enableI2cReadMode(int, I2cAddr, int, int)
Requests that the controller continually issue reads
to certain registers on a certain I2C device
@param physicalPort the port number on the controller
@param i2cAddress the I2C address of the device
@param memAddress the first register of the contiguous set to read
@param length the number of registers to read in a row

.method void enableI2cWriteMode(int, I2cAddr, int, int)
Requests that the controller issue a write
the next time it can to certain registers on a certain I2C device
@param physicalPort the port number on the controller
@param i2cAddress the I2C address of the device
@param memAddress the first register of the contiguous set to write to
@param length the number of registers to write to in a row

.method byte[] getCopyOfReadBuffer(int)
Gets an array containing precisely the last bytes read
from the current read request. Overwriting values in this array
doesn't affect the values stored by the controller.
The value at index 0 is the result from the lowest register and so on.
@param physicalPort the port number of the device on the controller

.method byte[] getCopyOfWriteBuffer(int)
Gets an array containing precisely the last bytes requested to be written
for the current write request. Overwriting values in this array
doesn't affect the values stored by the controller.
The value at index 0 is for the lowest register and so on.
@param physicalPort the port number of the device on the controller

.method void copyBufferIntoWriteBuffer(int, byte[])
Sets the bytes to be written for the current write request
@param physicalPort the port number of the device on the controller
@param buffer the values to write to the registers, starting at the lowest register

.method void setI2cPortActionFlag(int)
Tells the controller to issue whatever request was asked of it
@param port the port number of the device on the controller

.method void clearI2cPortActionFlag(int)
Tells the controller not to issue whatever request was asked of it.
Essentially, undoes {@link setI2cPortActionFlag(int)}.
@param port the port number of the device on the controller
@see setI2cPortActionFlag(int)

.method boolean isI2cPortActionFlagSet(int)
Returns whether {@link setI2cPortActionFlag(int)} was called more recently than {@link clearI2cPortActionFlag(int)}
for a certain device
@param port the port number of the device on the controller
@return whether the action will be performed

.method void readI2cCacheFromController(int)
Requests that the next values read from the controller are stored in this object.
If this method isn't called, the read buffer will not be updated.
@param port the port number of the device on the controller

.method void writeI2cCacheToController(int)
Requests that the current registers, read/write mode, and write data be sent to the controller.
This should be called after {@link readI2cCacheFromController(int)}
to avoid overwriting the data.
@param port the port number of the device on the controller

.method void writeI2cPortFlagOnlyToController(int)
Writes only the value of the action flag to the controller
@param port the port number of the device on the controller
@see setI2cPortActionFlag(int)
@see writeI2cCacheToController(int)

.method boolean isI2cPortInReadMode(int)
Gets whether the port is currently in read mode
@param port the port number of the device on the controller
@return true iff the port was last set in read mode

.method boolean isI2cPortInWriteMode(int)
Gets whether the port is currently in write mode
@param port the port number of the device on the controller
@return true iff the port was last set in write mode

.method boolean isI2cPortReady(int)
Gets whether the last request to the port has been completed.
@param port the port number of the device on the controller
@return true iff the port is ready for another request

.method Lock getI2cReadCacheLock(int)
Gets a lock on the read buffer so it can be directly read from.
By {@code lock()}ing the lock, you can be guaranteed that nothing else
will change the contents of the buffer before you unlock it.
It is generally easier to simply call {@link getCopyOfReadBuffer(int)}.
@param port the port number of the device on the controller
@return an object which allows you to gain temporary unique access to the read buffer

.method Lock getI2cWriteCacheLock(int)
Gets a lock on the write buffer so it can be directly written to.
By {@code lock()}ing the lock, you can be guaranteed that nothing else
will change the contents of the buffer or read from the buffer before you unlock it.
It is generally easier to simply call {@link copyBufferIntoWriteBuffer(int, byte[])}
or {@link getCopyOfWriteBuffer(int)}.
@param port the port number of the device on the controller
@return an object which allows you to gain temporary unique access to the write buffer

.method byte[] getI2cReadCache(int)
Gets a reference to the read buffer that won't change for the controller object.
The format is as follows:
<ul>
	<li>Byte 0: indicates either read or write</li>
	<li>Byte 1: the 8-bit I2C address of the device</li>
	<li>Byte 2: the lowest register in the contiguous set</li>
	<li>Byte 3: the number of registers in the contiguous set</li>
	<li>Bytes 4-30: the data</li>
	<li>Byte 31: the action flag</li>
</ul>
You should lock the buffer before using it.
@param port the port number of the device on the controller
@return a reference to the read buffer

.method byte[] getI2cWriteCache(int)
Gets a reference to the write buffer that won't change for the controller object.
The format is as follows:
<ul>
	<li>Byte 0: indicates either read or write</li>
	<li>Byte 1: the 8-bit I2C address of the device</li>
	<li>Byte 2: the lowest register in the contiguous set</li>
	<li>Byte 3: the number of registers in the contiguous set</li>
	<li>Bytes 4-30: the data</li>
	<li>Byte 31: the action flag</li>
</ul>
You should lock the buffer before using it.
@param port the port number of the device on the controller
@return a reference to the write buffer

.method void registerForI2cPortReadyCallback(I2cPortReadyCallback, int)

Only one callback can be set at a time for a single port.
