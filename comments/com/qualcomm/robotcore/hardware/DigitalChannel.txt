.class
Represents a digital port on a device.
Digital ports can be put in either input mode or output mode.
In input mode, they can determine whether they are receiving a digital signal or not.
In output mode, they can be made to send or not send a digital signal.

.method DigitalChannelController.Mode getMode()
Gets whether the port is being used as an input or an output
@return <b>INPUT</b> if being used as an input; <b>OUTPUT</b> if being used as an output

.method void setMode(DigitalChannelController.Mode)
Sets the port to be either an input or an output
@param mode the desired mode, either <b>INPUT</b> or <b>OUTPUT</b>

.method boolean getState()
Gets the signal level of the port.
If the port is set as an output port, it returns the last set value.
If the port is set as an input port, it returns the value currently being read.
@return true iff there is a signal on the port

.method void setState(boolean)
Sets whether the port is activated, if it is set as an output port.
If the port is set as an input, behavior is undefined.
@param state true to output a signal, false to stop outputing a signal

.method String getDeviceName()
@return the text "Digital Channel"

.method String getConnectionInfo()
Gets connection information about this device in a human-readable format,
e.g. {@code USB AL00VDDK; digital port 0}
@return the device and port this motor is attached to
