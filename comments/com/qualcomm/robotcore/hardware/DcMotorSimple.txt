.class
Represents a generic motorâ€”you can set its power and whether or not it is reversed.
Currently, {@link DcMotor} and {@link CRServo} are the only such devices.

.method void setDirection(Direction)
Sets the current direction that the motor is running in
@see Direction
@see getDirection()

.method Direction getDirection()
Gets the current direction that the motor is running in
@return the direction that the motor will move when set to a positive power
@see Direction
@see setDirection(Direction)

.method void setPower(double)
Sets the motor's power, where {@code -1.0} means full power backwards,
{@code 0.0} means stopped, and {@code 1.0} means full power forward.
In {@link DcMotor.RunMode#RUN_TO_POSITION RUN_TO_POSITION} mode,
sets the maximum power to send to the motor.
@param power the desired power (between -1 and 1)
@see getPower()

.method double getPower()
Returns the power that the motor is moving at, where {@code -1.0} means full power backwards,
{@code 0.0} means stopped or coasting, and {@code 1.0} means full power forward.
@return the motor's power value (between -1 and 1)
@see setPower(double)
